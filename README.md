# Basic Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for Sensor & Actuator Interfaces

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for sensor and actuator interfaces. The design is modular, allowing for easy replacement of simulated components with real hardware.

## Design Decisions
- **Abstraction:** Abstract base classes are used to define interfaces for sensors and actuators.
- **Simplicity:** Simulated implementations are provided to demonstrate the concept.
- **Modularity:** The design allows for easy swapping of simulated components with real hardware.

## Running the Demo
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `main.py` script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
